## Images

by controlling the image size, it helps the page load quickly.  Common picture sizes are: 

- Small Portrait: 220x360
- Small Landscape: 330x210
- Freature photo: 620x400

To center images: set `text-align: center` of the containing element, and use a `margin: auto` on the image. 

## Background Images

Use `background-image: url('image/example.jpg')` to insert a photo behind any HTML element.

As well as setting hte photo, you can also set how the image is repeated on the background (`repeat`,`repeat-x`,`repeat-y`,`no-repeat`,`fixed`,`scroll`).  

When the image is not repeated, you can `background-position:` to specify where the image should be placed.

## Practical Information

(SEO) Search Engine Optimization is split into: *On-Page* and *Off-Page* techniques.  These help get your webpage to get to top results when users search for your page.  

***Off-Page*** get other sites to link up to your webpage.

***On-Page*** what are the key words that users will search for when looking up your page?  Include these in your site text and HTML code.  Search engines rely alot on the text on our sites, so that makes text important. `Alt` text on images also helps search engines understand the content. Here a list of key places where keywords should appear for better SEO. 

1. Page Title
2. URL/Web address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Description

To identify what key words should be used here are a few steps the team can do to come up with them: *Brainstorm, Orgainize, Research, Compare, Refine and Map*

**Google Analytics** is a free service that tracks how users are using your site.  Put the tracking code within your <HEAD> tag on  your page. 

**Domain Name and Hosting** to officially put your page on the web, it will need a registered domain name.  Most webpages are hosted on web servers. Below are a few: 

[FileZilla](filezilla-project.org) \| [FireFTP](fireftp.mozdev.org)
\| [CuteFTP](cuteftp.com) \| [SmartFTP](smartftp.com) \| [Transmit](panic.com/transmit)

### Video & Audio

`HTMLMediaElement` features allow us to control video/audio playback.  the same features are able to be used for audio, except for setting height/width since there is no visible representation for it.
