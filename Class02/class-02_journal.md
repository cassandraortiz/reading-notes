# Class02 - What I learned today...

This class was a refresher to the Course 102 we took.  We started to develop our website with the correct file types, what they consist of and how to reference them. The biggest take away that I had was the full structure setup within Terminal and the config files. 

Below is the proper initial setup for our website.

In Terminal:

 to create a Folder/Directory: `mkdir (foldername)`

 to create file: `touch (filename.ext)`

hidden files will begin with a `.`
