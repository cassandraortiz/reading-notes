# Class02 - What I learned today...

## Journal Reading

For this entry we needed to read an exerpt on different types of Learning.  Primarily **Pedagogy** (Child Learning) vs **Andragogy** (Adult Learning)

Here are the Five major differences: 
1. Leaning Behavior
 - ADULTS: are self directed, own control of their learning, are 100% responsible and are involved in planning/evaluating
 - KIDS: a dependent on teachers
2. Role of Learners' Experience
 - ADULTS: person experience plays a big pare of diversity in learning
 - KIDS: they dont have much experience
3. Orientation
 - ADULTS: pick an area of focus, based on personal/work skills useful for them 
 - KIDS: force the subject matter presented
4. Readiness
 - ADULTS: Get to pick their "Why", "What", "When" 
 - KIDS: told what/when etc.
5. Motivation
 - ADULTS: Have the internal drive to succed (self-development, better life, curiosity, etc.) 
 - KIDS: have more external drive (grades, good college, avoid failures)

## Lecture Learning

This class was a refresher to the Course 102 we took.  We started to develop our website with the correct file types, what they consist of and how to reference them. The biggest take away that I had was the full structure setup within Terminal and the config files. 

Below is the proper initial setup for our website.

In Terminal:

 to create a Folder/Directory: `mkdir (foldername)`

 to create file: `touch (filename.ext)`

hidden files will begin with a `.`
