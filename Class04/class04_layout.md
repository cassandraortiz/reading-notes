# Layouts

## Positioning Elements

***Block-Level elements*** treat each as its own box, while ***inline elements*** only effect the inline text. 

Sizes of boxes are controled by *height* and *width*, while the space between boxes and contents is controlled by ***margin, border,*** and ***padding***.

| Scheme | Description | Example |
| :----- | :---------- | ------- |
| Normal Flow (Static)| Each item appears on its own line and down the page.| |
| Relative Positioning| The would shift the position the item *top, right, bottom or left* <br /> This does not effect surrounding elements | |
| Absolute Positioning | Moves the elements position, it is taken out of normal flow. | |
| Fixed Positioning | Does not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page | |
| Floating Elements | allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.| |

***z-index*** controls the layers of what box is on top if it coems out of the normal flow. The value is a number, where higher the number the closer it appears on the top.
