# CSS Styling Animations

In all of these articles we learned about how to do transformations and animations.  

## Transformations

- rotate elements:  `transform: rotate(20deg)`
- scale elements: `transform: scale(.75)` also `transform: scaleY(1.15)`
- push/pull element in certain direction: `transform: translateX(-10px)`
- skew element in a direction: `transform: skewX(5deg)`
- change perspective: `transform: perspective(200px) rotateX(45deg)`

## Transitions

Use psuedo code on elements (i.e :Hover)

- `transition-property: background, border-radius`
- `transition-duration: .2s, 1s`
- `transition-timing-function: linear`
- `transition-delay: 0s, 1s`

## Wow my Users

- Fade In: `.fade` set first and then set `.fade:hover`
- Change Color: `.color:hover`
- Grow & Shrink: `.grow:hover` and `shrink:hover`
- Rotate elements
- Square to circle
- 3D shadow
- Swing
