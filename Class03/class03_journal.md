# Class03 - What I learned today...

## Journal Reflection

> “For adult learners, their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning.” 

My life experiences have played a big part in my developement as a software developer.  I've had lots of experience at work with SQL and VisualBasic, this has given me a good perspective on logical statements and how basic code will function.  In addition, I've had a lot of experience with PhotoShop and other design tools.  This helps me with  the understanding of how things relate in CSS.  I am finding this class informative and a nice challenge to put everything together.  The stacked learning keeps my attention peaked.

## Lecture Learning

Today we  went over the Box models and how margin/border/padding effect the element.  Additionally, we touched base on **Arrays**.  This really peaked my interest, because there is so much we can do with it.  

- I learned how the arrays are stored within the computer, and take up 'space' if they are changed.
- How to call arrays by their index `array[0]`
- How to add into the arrays `array[6]='something'`
- Arrays can hold multiple data types

**TRUTHY & FALSY**

when using `use strict` in our javaScript files, both the DataType & Value need to match in order for it to result in a *Truthy*, everything else will be a *Falsy*.

**PAIRED PROGRAMMING**

We also watched our TA's demonstrate *paired programming*, This is where one individual (*navigator*) will speak the directions, and the other (*driver*) will be the one that types out the code.  -- This limits the code to one train of thought.
