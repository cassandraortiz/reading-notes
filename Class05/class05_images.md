# Images  *(pgs 94-125)*

Great images help make the difference between average and engaging sites.

Images should: 
- be Relevant
- Convey Information

Store site images in folder called ***images***.  Can always add subfolders for larger sites called ***interface*** or ***products***.

## Adding Images

`<img src="/pics/smiley.jpg" alt="smiling sloth" title="Happy Little Sloth"/>`

 - `src` - tells where the image is located
 - `alt` - accesibility tag - describing image for blind users
 - `title` -  tag shown when hover over image

### Image Placement

1. IMAGE BEFORE PARAGRAPH

<img src="/pics/smiley.jpg" alt="smiling sloth" width="100"/>
<p> Isn't this sloth just the cutest little thing? He wants to tell you a joke... What do you call a three-humped camel?? ... Pregnant! .... Ha-ha-Ha~!</p>

1. IMAGE INSIDE PARAGRAPH

<p><img src="/pics/smiley.jpg" alt="smiling sloth" width="100"/> Isn't this sloth just the cutest little thing? He wants to tell you a joke... What do you call a three-humped camel?? ... Pregnant! .... Ha-ha-Ha~!</p>

4. HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT (LEFT & RIGHT)

### Formats

*.jpg* - colored pictures (many pixels)

*.gif* / *.png* - images with few colors (flat color); such as logo, illustrations and diagrams.

**Image resolution** - Images created for the web, should have a resolution of: **72 ppi**.  Large images increase size of the file.

*.svg* - vector images - images with transparent backgrounds

*GIFs* - animated gifs, (ex. spinning wheel) should only be used for simple illustrations.
